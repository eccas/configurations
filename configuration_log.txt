150211: Installed Mathematica 10. In the last step I got the message: 
        The scripts 'mcc' already exist in the directory /usr/local/bin. The following actions can be performed on the existing file(s).

          (1) Overwrite
          (2) Rename
          (3) Cancel

          Type your selection, or press ENTER to select (1):
          > 2

          Type a file name extension to be appended to the name of the existing file(s), or press ENTER to select (.old):
          >
          Hence, what I did was to rename the existing mcc to mcc.old.
